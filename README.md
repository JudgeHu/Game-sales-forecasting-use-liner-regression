# 项目简述
本项目的核心目标是为了给《黑神话：悟空》设计营销方案，在设计营销方案之前，我们希望构建一个量化模型来预测游戏的销量。
所有的数据从SteamDB平台获取
通过对数据的初步检查，我们认为游戏的关注者数量和游戏销量之间存在线性关系，可以构建线性回归模型来进行预测。
我们筛选了25款游戏，从SteamDB平台下载了对应的数据。
其中，关注者数据直接选取了SteamDB的数据，销量数据选择了VGinsight的统计结果。

# Brief description of the project
The core objective of this project is to design a marketing plan for Black Myth: Wukong, before designing the marketing plan, we would like to construct a quantitative model to predict the sales of the game. All data were obtained from the SteamDB platform Through preliminary examination of the data, we concluded that there is a linear relationship between the number of followers of a game and the sales of the game, and a linear regression model can be constructed to make predictions. We screened 25 games and downloaded the corresponding data from the SteamDB platform. Among them, the follower data were directly selected from SteamDB, and the sales data were selected from the statistics of VGinsight.
